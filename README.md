# Life Race
Life Race is a gamified learning experience that explains human conception. Use head maneuvers to control sperm. That simple.


<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
We are solving the problem of rote learning through game based learning. We are also socially sensitizing the community about gender based discrimination before birth

<br/>

<h3>Solution</h3>
Our innovation is a game which would embody learning within the structure of the gaming world and the player's interactions with it. The game would allow the player re-enact their first ever epic adventure. The player will be presented with a challenging simulation of a spermâ€™s journey through the reproductive track using VR. The player thereby gets to experience the invisible odds a single sperm faces to fuse with an egg and form a new life.

Our aim is to co-join education with gaming not in form of edutainment but in form of playful learning to provide academic benefits. We also hope to pass across the message and understanding that every child was born a winner regardless of sex.

<h3>Benefits of VR</h3>
Improved Learning: Better learning experiences come when engaged in an immersive activity (experience is the best teacher).

Improved Motivation: The fact that it's educational will be almost entirely irrelevant to the player.
